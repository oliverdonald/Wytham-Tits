A quick exploration of natal dispersal dynamics in two Oxford study areas- Wytham Woods and Bagley Wood.
Research shows that there are sex differences in dispersal dynamics so I investigated how these interacted with temperature and population size.
Although there were negative relationships for all linear regression models (i.e. as population size and temperature increased mean dispersal distance decreased)
Temperature was taken as the May mean temperature for the year since this is the common time for fledging; future analyses will investigate the relationship between mean dispersal distance and temperatures around August and September since this is the typical time juveniles disperse so could be a better predictor of mean dispersal distance.

A further analysis, also within this repository investigates how breeding population density and habitat quality (either deciduous or coniferous forest) interact to influence the proportion of birds which did not disperse from their natal plot.
The data was collected over 7 years across a density by habitat matrix within Bagley Wood. I found that there was no significant effect of breeding population density [P = 0.377], which was surprising given research done by Wilkin et al. 2009, but a significant effect of habitat type was found [P = 0.018] (which lines up with data by Wilkins et al. 2006 and Blondel et al. 1991)
There was no significant interactive effect [P = 0.542].

My data has relevance for metapopulation anaylses, especially important in light of anthropogenic habitat degradation and fragmentation. By understanding how natal dispersal might modulate population structure, density, and distribution, we can look to use this behaviour to maintain genetic diversity and ecological viability within metapopulations. This analysis therefore acts as the basis for a model to help in the conservation of endangered species.
